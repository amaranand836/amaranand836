My daily Python problems:-

#Write a Python program that inputs three integers and calculates and prints out their sum. However, if the three numbers are all equal then print out three times their sum.

Program Code:

int1 = int(input("Enter integer 1: "))
int2 = int(input("Enter integer 2: "))
int3 = int(input("Enter integer 3: "))


if int1 == int2 and int2 == int3:
    print(3*(int1+int2+int3))
else:
    print(int1+int2+int3)
    
    
#Write a Python program that takes in an input of an integer grade. Based on the following, print out the corresponding letter grade:

“A” : grade >= 90
“B” : 80 <= grade < 90
“C” : 70 <= grade < 80
“D” : 60 <= grade < 70
“F” : grade < 60

Program Code:

grade = int(input("Enter grade: "))

if grade >= 90:
    print("A")
elif grade >= 80:
    print("B")
elif grade >= 70:
    print("C")
elif grade >= 60:
    print("D")
elif grade < 60:
    print("F")
    
    
#Leap years are years that are divisible by four. Write a Python program that inputs a year from the user and prints out whether it was a leap year or not.

Program Code:

year = int(input("Please enter year: "))

if year % 4 == 0:
    print("Leap year")
else:
    print("Not leap year")
