My Python problems:-

#Write a Python program that inputs a user's first and last name and prints them in reverse order with a space in between.

Program Code:

first_name = input("Input your First Name: ")
last_name = input("Input your Last Name: ")

print (last_name + " " + first_name)


#Write a Python program that inputs two integers and prints out the sum of the integers.

Program Code:

num1 = int(input("First number: "))
num2 = int(input("Second number: "))

print(num1 + num2)

#Write a Python program that takes in the number of chickens, cows, and pigs (respectively) a farmer has. Print out the sum of the legs across all animals.

Chickens = 2 legs
Cows = 4 legs
Pigs = 4 legs

Program Code:

chickens = int(input("Number of chickens: "))
cows = int(input("Number of cows: "))
pigs = int(input("Number of pigs: "))

print(chickens*2 + cows*4 + pigs*4)
