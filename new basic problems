#2. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.

Code:
r = int(input("Enter the Radius : "))
area = 3.14*r**2
print(area)

#4. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers.

Code:
values = input("Input some comma seprated numbers : ")
list = values.split(",")
tuple = tuple(list)
print('List : ',list)
print('Tuple : ',tuple)

#5. Write a Python program to accept a filename from the user and print the extension of that.

Code:
filename = input("Enter the file name : ")
file_ext = filename.split(".")
print(file_ext[-1])

#6. Write a Python program to display the first and last colors from the following list.

Code:
color_list = ["Red","Green","White" ,"Black"]
print(color_list[0], color_list[-1])

#7. Write a Python program to display the examination schedule.

Code:
exam_st_date = (11,12,2014)
print( "The examination will start from : %i / %i / %i"%exam_st_date)

#8. Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers.
Given two integer numbers return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000, else return their sum.

Code:

num1 = int(input("Enter the first number : "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number : "))
sum = num1 + num2
muliply = num1 * num2
if muliply <= 1000:
    print(muliply)
else:
    print(sum)
